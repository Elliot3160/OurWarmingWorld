                This blog post is the first of it's kind to feature on my website. I envision this website to be used as a tool to educate people about geology, physical geography, palaeoclimatology and palaeontology, but also to inspire a sense of care for our world. This blog forms one post of many, many more to come as I build up my platform "Our Warming World". My platform will consist of insights and blogs posts covering multiple geological time periods, to increase awareness of climate change and how the aforementioned subjects provide an array of supporting evidence.

            My eyes caressed the undulating coastline as I peered over the sea wall railings. "East Cliffs, Black Ven, Golden Cap...the most famous cliffs in the world" I muttered as the sea breeze tickled my face. From ammonites to ichthyosaurs, an array of prehistoric life rests peacefully within these rocks until the relentless crashing of waves beckons their resurrection. I began munching on my cheese sandwich, freshly made before my 5am dash to Egham train station earlier that morning.

            The tide was now beginning to fall and a crowd of fossil fanatics began accumulating at the sea wall, waiting to sweep the beach of all its timeless treasures. Two bravely impatient hunters skipped down the steps, traversed a rocky ridge, and hugged the base of the Jurassic cliffs. I watched closely, soon to follow their noble charge down to the beach. But I wasn't quite ready. Something didn't seem smart about walking so close to those limestone monoliths. I had been observing how slabs of the blue lias limestone jutted out from the cliffs and concluded that was not the place I wanted to be. Or worse...end up fossilised myself if the cliffs collapsed! Whilst fossil hunting is amazing fun, collecting rocks is not worth risking injury, or worse. I watched as the pair persevered their way towards Charmouth, a small town nestled within the v-shaped relief of the Jurassic cliffs. Squinting my eyes revealed the small cement factory overlooking the coastline. "That's ichthyosaur territory" I smiled. The Black Ven marls are famous for harbouring the remains of the dolphin like, marine reptiles - ichthyosaurs. Little did I know, that later today I would encounter my very own...

            Finally I had plucked up the courage to venture down to the beach. But the waves were still relentlessly smashing the shoreline - I had to time my traverse quickly and safely in and amongst the attacking waves. I watched the rhythm of their retreat...one big wave, two small waves. "But does that give me enough time to run across the ledge?" I stood and calculated my window of error so I could ensure I wouldn't be shamefully soaked infront of the other fossil hunters. Suddenly I bolted for where the waves could no longer reach. My white Adidas high-tops clapped the surface of the limestone ledge as I dodged slimey patches of seaweed. The salty sea spattered the rocks, splashing water high into the air around me, but thankfully I remained dry. I had made it safely across 'wave alley' and could now begin fossil hunting.

            The time to turn my eyes from the sea to the sand had arrived. My first find immediately lay before me. A devil's toe nail. It's curvy calcitic shell beamed bluey grey - I instantly seized it and slipped it into my pocket. It must have just fallen out of the cliffs. This first discovery is a brachiopod, specifically a type of oyster. It's lower shell appearing hemispheric with a cerrated texture as marked by growth lines, similarly to an...overgrown toenail (yuck!). Scientifically it is called <i>Gryphaea arcuata</i> (a name which strangely won't gross you out!). This fossil is relatively common in Britain and can be found across the country where appropriately aged sedimentary rocks are exposed. During its heyday roughly 180 million years ago, it would have lived in warm shallow seas. The fact we find <i>Gryphaea arcuata</i> at Lyme Regis implies it was at one point in time, a warm and shallow tropical-like sea! Fossils are more than just a hobby. For scientists they help us reconstruct environments and demonstrate shifts in climate. One person's hobby may be one scientist's tool.

            I continued venturing along the beach, peering under boulders, lodging my geological hammer to leverage rocks and scrape through gravels. When fossil hunting, simple geomorphological knowledge may be the difference between finding many fossils, or just one. geomorphology is all about the way sediment of different sizes: clays, silts, sands, cobbles, pebbles, boulders move across environments. Different size sediments require different amounts of energy to move. Whilst fossil hunting amongst coastal environments, sediment (and fossils!) become organised, or sorted, based on their size as the energy within the water changes. Next time you're at a sandy beach, look at how smaller rocks and gravels coalesce around larger rocks, possibly boulders. They haven't always been sitting there like that. Each time those sediments interact with the water they are sorted based on sizes, organised into certain patterns. For the fossil hunter, this is everything. Similar sized objects can therefore be found in similar areas. So if you want to find an ichthyosaur vertebra...look for ichthyosaur vertebra sized rocks! Using this method (and with considerable luck), I found one lurking beneath a large, desk sized boulder. My eyes were attracted to it because of it's unique bow tie shape, but this one was broken in half. Complete vertebra are round, like a dinner plate with a lip at the edge, leading to a dip at the centre. If you're extra lucky it may have spokes attached, and blobs where ribs would have joined the spine. Thankfully, mine had two blobs, organised slightly diagonally, suggesting this vertebra was part of the abdomen of the ichthyosaur. Larger vertebrae are found in the main body, and smaller vertebrae occur closer to the tail. The positioning of external attachments on vertebrae helps palaeontologists to assemble fossil skeletons...sort of like a giant biological puzzle.
