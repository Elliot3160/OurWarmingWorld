                    A bit about the author...
                </h3>
                Welcome to the navigation hub! Here you can access all pages included in this climate change series using the links in the navigation bar, or the buttons below! Please note that some are currently under development.

                This series of websites was created by Elliot May, a postgraduate student of Quaternary Science at Royal Holloway University of London. After graduating from the University of Southampton with a First Class BSc (Honours) degree, he completed a summer internship with Atoma Research. During this internship he researched sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and the role of contrail cirrus in short term climate forcings. Interested in learning more about the author? Why not check out the 'Author's Profile?' (coming soon).

                        If you're new to earth sciences, you may not be familiar with geological time. Their names are abstract and far from finding their way in every day colloquialisms. But their meanings are deep and rich. Each link is a period of geological time in which we will dive into and learn more about. You can visit the Home page for a more detailed introduction!

                        The Anthropocene is a hotly debated, unofficial period, which is characterised by extentsive human induced climate forcing. Visit this page if you want to learn more about how humans have influenced the climate and the climate mitigating strategies we are rolling out to meet sustainability goals.

                        The Quaternary period is the current geological epoch spanning from today to 2.6 million years ago. This period is marked by glacial-interglacial cycles, better known as Ice Ages (yes, the film series...).

                    <p>
                        The Tertiary period is the previous epoch spanning from 2.6 million years ago to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. In the Tertiary period mammals surged into dominance and rapidly diversified after the demise of the terrible lizards.

                        The Mesozoic is the geological period where dinosaurs ruled the world. This period spanned from 66 million years ago to 250 million years ago.

                        The Palaeozoic is the geological epoch in which multicellular life began. Here, the basic body plans for biological radiation were formed. Trilobites ruled the seas with their super vision and calcite armoured bodies. The palaeozoic spanned from 250 million years ago to 500 million years ago. Once our planet began hosting multicellular life, it evolved and diversfified rapidly.
